This repository is dedicated to my research of the Transformer machine learning model. 

What is a Transformer? 
A Transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention,the self-attention mechanism differentially weighs the significance of each part of the input data. Transformers are commonly used within the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision(CV).
